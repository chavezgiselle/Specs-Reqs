###How to model workflows

	-We introduced use cases to represent what the system should do
	-Introduce activity diagrams to represent how the busiess process 

###UML Activity Diagrams

	-Easy to follow and most widely used
	-Show a business process
	-Activity is being modelered
	-Action is part of the activity(step)
	-Part of Process View
	
	-Initial Node: Indicated by a full black circle
	-Actions: Rounded rectangles indicating:
		-A behavior performed
		-A Computation
		-A key step in a process

###From Action to Activity

	-Activity Frame is optional
	-Use it when more than one activity is shown

###Simplifying Diagrams

	-Upside down pitch fork 

###Time Events

	-Time may be a factor in activity
		-Model a wait period
		-Model a process repeating at the regular interval

###Objects in Activity Diagrams

	-Objects can be depicted as rectangles
	
###Flow Final Node

	-Sometimes a flow terminates its own path, not the whole actvity
	-to wait on all actions, use a join

###Partitions
	
	-a.k.a Swimlanes
